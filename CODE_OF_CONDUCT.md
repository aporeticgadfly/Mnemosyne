# Code of Conduct

## 1. Culture
- Be cordial to others.
- Open, good faith discussion is always welcome.
- Aggressive ideological proselytizing is extremely frowned upon.
- Do not use crude heuristics when superior ones are available (eg. when evaluating someones character).
- Be intentional with what you say.
- Making personal attacks, raising one's voice, etc makes it seem like you're losing the argument.
- Do not advertise random nonsense.

## 2. Collaboration
- Welcome new contributors and help answer questions.
- Provide constructive feedback.
- Try to do your homework before asking a question directly (search engines, documentation, stack overflow, references). Not only does this ease maintenance burden on us, it makes you a better problem solver and therefore a better developer. It will likely also be quicker for you. This is meant in the nicest way possible and is meant to help you. An attitude of curiosity and independence will make you more competent and will increase the desire to help you when you really do need assistance.

## 3. Reporting Violations
If you observe behavior that violates this Code of Conduct, please report it to equivocatemolecule@protonmail.com.
